            Every day we are unwillingly captured by cameras designed to capture automobiles, but what does it mean
            when we choose to be captured?

            I was intrigued by this dichotomy between these two lenses, and how they meet in the middle.

            <div> I think what Iâ€™m trying to show is that it feels weird to be the observer in this
                situation, to see myself through myself. An easier way to put it is that I am exploring the act of
                recording myself to salvage some lost power. Really, I chose to do this project
                from an Instagram reel on this fun website where you can take cute photos of ourselves in traffic
                cameras. And so I encourage you to do so.
